Hello! My name is Lucy Storts and I am a senior studying Statistics at Brigham Young University. I took a statistics class in high school and was fascinated by all the different fields statistics can be applicatied to. This is my last semester of school and I am very excited to graduate!

Some of my interests outside of school and work include hiking, traveling, beading jewelry, and playing with my dog, Benson. He lives with my parents while I am in school, but I am excited to reunite when I graduate.

Some of my professional interests include epidemiological data, climate change, women's health, healthcare data, bioinformatics, and application of machine learning to the study of genetics. I believe the "hard-to-answer" questions can be answered through data collection and analysis, and I am excited to share and apply what I've been studying to real world problems. 

Finally, I wanted to thank you for checking out my blog! Just for fun, here are a couple pictures I took last summer while hiking at Glacier NP...

Using this new datatable, I will be able to do both Q→Q and C→Q analysis. I want to compare the 2022 Delays proportion to the Elevation metric using scatterplot and possibly regression. Next, I want to compare all airports by their Avg. Delay (Mins) in a bar chart, organized by descending order, not rank.

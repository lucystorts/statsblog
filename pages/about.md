###  Hello! 
My name is Lucy Storts. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Statistical Science and I am passionate about applying statistical methodologies to real-world scenarios. My academic background has equipped me with expertise in various aspects of statistical analysis, including experimental design, data collection and interpretation, visualization techniques, and statistical programming.

Throughout my college years, I studied many statistical principles and gained practical experience as a Teacher Assistant over multiple semesters. This job required that I know fundamental statistical concepts thoroughly and be ready to answer any question a student might have. 

Proficient in a range of statistical programming languages such as R, Python, SAS, SQL, as well as in tools like MS Word and Excel, I am adept at leveraging these technologies to analyze data and derive meaningful insights. My strong organizational and managerial skills ensure efficient project coordination and meticulous record management, vital for maintaining accuracy and integrity in statistical analyses.

I have a  passion for exploring the applications of statistical science in diverse fields and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to projects that require rigorous analysis and data-driven decision-making.

Some of my interests outside of work include hiking, traveling, arts & crafts, reading, taking care of my houseplants, and playing with my sister's dog, Benson. <br>

Some of my professional interests include epidemiological data, climate change, women's health, healthcare data, genetics, data visualization, and data collection & cleaning. I believe the "hard-to-answer" questions can be answered through data science processes and I am excited to share and apply what I've been studying to real world situations. <br>

Finally, I wanted to thank you for checking out my blog! Just for fun, here are a couple pictures I took while hiking at Glacier NP in 2022...
